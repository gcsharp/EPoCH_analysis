# Run observational and PRS pheWAS #
####################################

# The following script runs all the multivariable regression analyses for EPoCH.
# Specifically, it runs:
#  - observational pheWAS of every exposure (basic, trimester specific, source specific, etc) on every outcome using models 1-4
#  - MR-pheWAS of every polygenic risk score on every outcome using model 1
# pheWAS results for only the "basic" exposures, generated using model 1, will be presented as pheWAS in EPoCH papers
# results for other models, exposure timepoints, doses, etc will be presented for specific exposure/outcome combinations identified by the pheWAS
# However, the web app will enable users to see pheWAS results for any exposure

# The code will likely take a long time to run and is probably best submitted as a job on bluecrystal.

The rationale was that all mums are genetically related to their children so we wanted all included dads to be genetically related too (else the maternal effect may appear larger than the paternal effect due to non-paternity). Also for prenatal exposures we would expect all direct paternal effects to go via the sperm, so would want biological dads. However, we're also interested in indirect effects (via the mother), in which case paternity wouldn't be important. Also we don't have a perfect measure of paternity (just maternal-report). May be better to do a sensitivity analysis restricting to biological dads (n=13036), but use all dads in the main analysis.
