The Exploring Prenatal influences on Childhood Health, or EPoCH project, investigates how parentsâ€™ lifestyles in the important prenatal period might affect the health of their children.

The main analysts for the EPoCH study are Gemma Sharp (PI) and Kayleigh Easey.

## EPoCH involves four main stages:

### 1. Data preparation and summarising stage

Preparing and harmonising data between the main EPoCH cohorts: ALSPAC, Born in Bradford, Millenium Cohort Study, MoBa.

Code for this stage is found in the data_prep folder.

### 2. Cohort analysis

For each cohort, we run multivariable regression analyses of the association between all combinations of exposures and outcomes. What we end up with is a sort of mini phenome-wide association study (pheWAS) for each exposure of interest.

This stage involves:

* Making a pheWAS "key" to describe the covariates that should be adjusted for for each combination of exposure and outcome. The code for this is found in the making_key folder.
* Running the pheWAS. The code for this is found in the phewas folder.
* Running some QC on the results. The code for this is found in the cohort_qc folder.

### 3. Meta-analysis and combining results

We then run fixed effects meta-analysis on the results from each cohort. The code is found in the meta_analysis folder.
Results are then combined (with a final bit of QC) using the combine_clean_meta_results script.

### 4. Triangulation

Evidence from different analyses is 'triangulated' (combined) to assess the degree of confidence in an exposure-outcome association reflecting a causal relationship.
